# Predictive-maintenance
Predictive maintenance approach using deep learning and survival analysis

# Experiment 1 : NASA Turbofan degredation dataset for Predictive maintenance. 
The code implements the following :
1. A normalized risk index score to determine turbofan engine health trend using NeuralMLTR Survival model. 
2. A RUL prediction model using a base model - random forests

Please open notebook to find out more details about the experiment.
